# README

## Overview

This directory is dedicated to Verse Volumes, an alternative approach to handling trigger volume enter/exit events for agents with a `fort_character` in Fortnite Creative using the Verse programming language within the UEFN/Creative ecosystem.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to:
- Provide a focused environment for experimenting with Verse Volumes, which offer a more memory-efficient and flexible solution compared to traditional volumes.

## Structure

- **VerseVolumes**: Contains Verse scripts and assets tailored for testing and experimentation. These scripts utilize an object-oriented programming (OOP) design with multiple interfaces and abstract classes to define the behavior and structure of a "volume."

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Drop the "Volume Manager Device" device into your level.
3. Construct a volume in the details panel
4. Specify positions or references to "props" to control positioning and scaling of the volumes.
5. Leverage the benefits of Verse Volumes, such as reduced memory usage and support for more flexible shapes, to enhance your designs and experience. Use these Verse Volumes in scenarios where you would typically rely on Mutator Zone devices, taking advantage of their flexibility and efficiency.
